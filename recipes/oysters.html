<h1>Oysters on the Half Shell with Rose Mignonette</h1>
<img src="oysters.jpeg" alt="oysterspic.jpeg">
<p>Great oysters are delicious "naked," as Island Creek founder Skip Bennett says, but sometimes chef Jeremy Sewall dresses them up with a mignonette (vinegar sauce) like this one, made with sparkling ros√©.</p>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup sparkling rose</li>
    <li>2 shallots, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
    <li>2 dozen oysters, shucked</li>
    <li>Shaved ice, for serving</li>
</ul>
<p>In a bowl, combine the rose, shallots, vinegar and pepper. Arrange the oysters on a bed of ice and serve with the mignonette.
